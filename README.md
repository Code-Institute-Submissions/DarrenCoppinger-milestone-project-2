</h2>

A website designed to gather together information on interesting literary sites around Ireland. The website aims to achieve the following criteria:
* Provide a convenient centralised location to highligh interesting literary locations. Particularly those that are lesser known. 
* The website must provide an interactive maps for interested parties to investigate highlighted locations and gather further information.
* The website should provide a form that allows visitors of the site to contribute to the database and submit a location to be added to the interactive map. These submissions will be reviewed by the sites moderator and added if approriate.

This website will present a literary sensibility providing a sense of the heritage of Irish literary history.

The fonts were chosen to give a classic writer feel so a typewriter like font was chosen for the headings with a complementary font for the bodies of text. The fonts were sourced from Google Fonts and are as follows:
* <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Special+Elite" target="_blank">Special Elite</a>
* <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Oswald" target="_blank">Oswald</a>

## UX

### Design Objectives:

* Is the content appropriate for the audience:

The audience for this website will be english speaking tourists and literary fans, and writers. The audience is likely a young technology savvy audience and will likely access the site on mobile devices. A mobile first approach was considered appropriate for this type of audience. Although the website will accommodate all visitors its primary audience will be technology literate.

* Is the content relevant?

Yes the content on this site is a relevant to Irish Literature. Additonal content can be submitted by users through the "Submission" page form and this content will be curated by the website moderator. 

* Is the content grouped in an intuitive way?

The content is grouped into easily understood sections (Home, Map, Submissions).

The site also aims to have a old-school retro writing aesthetic to reflect the historic nature of the source material. 

* Is the technology for this content appropriate?

A standard website has been chosen as the method to distribute this information as it allows the use of an interactive maps powered by Google Maps.

### Business Strategy

* What is the product this website is selling?

The product that we are trying to sell is the centralised repository for interesting literary locations around Ireland.

* What value are we trying to add to this?

By providing a map to show the geographical locations of these sites tourists and interested parties will be able to plan trips to cities and regions based on the interesting sites available there.

* What has been done like this before?

To the developers knowledge this is the first of this type of site developed focusing on Irish literature. However, many sites make up of the Google Maps API.

    
* What are the technology considerations 

A website is an appropriate technology to reach the widest possible audience and allows the use of the Google Maps API.

* Why would a user want this product? Whatâ€™s worth doing?

Through interviews with  potential users of this website a list of development priorities were established. An importance versus viability analysis was also conducted, the results of which are as follows:

<a href="https://ibb.co/V2V7D0K" target="_blank"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/WgnbFNT/importance-v-viability-ms2.jpg" alt="importance-v-viability-ms2" border="0"></a>

The development priorities for this project are as follows:
1.	Provide central location to hold literary locations around Ireland
2.	Provide a mechanism for displaying literary locations around Ireland 
3.	Create a mechanism for the submission of new location from interested parties
4.	Provide central location for all social media links
5.	Develop section dedicated to selected authors and highlight all locations associate with them

Due to time/resource the final objective was not completed and will be inplimented at a later stage of development of this site.

## Features
### Existing Features
### All Pages
The website has a responsive navigation bar and title at the top of the page. The title also acts as a "Home" button.

On the footer of each page are social media icons link the the Writers of Ireland social media profiles.

#### Home
The page has a carousel which transition with a fade between images of different Irish writers. The carousel also has previous and next control buttons on the left and right of the images, respectively.

The page includes an "About Us" section which is contained inside a jumbotron. At the bottom of the jumbotron there are links in the form of buttons linking to the other pages of the website and explaining their function. 

#### Map
The Map page shows a display of a Google Maps API embedded map. The map is focused on Ireland.

The google maps interface has be augmented in a number of ways. 

Firstly the map is not the google maps default but a styled version. This version aims to provide a retro feel and blend in with the websites old-school aesthetic.

The map controls have been customised to so that the map style control buttons are located at the bottom of the map in the center of the interface. The zoom and street view controls have also been moved to the center of the right hand side of the interface. The full screen control feature has also been moved to the center of the right hand side of the interface.

A search box (or Place Autocomplete Card) with autocomplete functionality has been included in the map, this is achieve using a google "Place Autocomplete widget". Radio buttons in the search box allow the user to filter the types of predictions that the autocomplete returns. These filters are by establishments, address and geocodes. 

The searches in this box have also been limited to the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, this is achieved using the strictBounds function and defining the coordinates around the island of Ireland. 

Google marker clustering has also been applied to the map to allow markers placed close together to be combined when the maps is zoomed out.

Infowindows have been included on all markers on the map. When a particular marker is clicked an infowindow will be displayed with information on the location and image and a link for futher information on location or associated writer.

### Features left to Implement
Due to time constraints the writers page of the website was not implemented.

    2. Hover over the Name Header text "Writers of Ireland" to check that the hover effects work.
    3. Click the Name Header text "Writers of Ireland" to check that it links to the Home page.
    4. Hover over each navbar item to check the hover effect works for each one.
    5. Click on each one of the navbar buttons to ensure that each links to the correct page.
    6. Alter the screen size from desktop size down to small devices (sm) size to check that the navbar is responsive. At that size the navbar changes to the toggler icon.
    7. Click the toggler icon to check that the drop-down menu activates.
    8. Hover over each of the drop-down menu buttons to make sure the hover effect activates.
    9. Click each of the drop-down menu buttons to make sure that they links to the correct page.
2. Carousel
    1. Visit the Home page and see the carousel under the navbar.
    2. Click the forward and back arrows on either side of the slides.
    3. Wait to see that the fade transition works correctly for carousel images.
3. Jumbotron

    2. Hover over each of the footer social media buttons to ensure that they react to correctly
    3. Click each of the social media buttons to ensure that they launch the correct social media account in another page
    4. Alter the screen size from desktop size down to mobile (sm) size to check that footer is responsive. At the sm screen size the footer should reform into two rows of two columns.
5.  Responsinator
    1. Review of all functionality and responsiveness on mobile screen size by using <a href="https://www.responsinator.com/">Responsinator</a>

#### Map

1. Repeat Navbar checks as described in step one of the Home section
2. Embedded Google Map Place Autocomplete Card, check that the searches using the seach bar in the card filter prediction based on which radio button is press (All, Establishments, Addresses or Geocodes)
3. Check that the zoom, full screen and streetview buttons as well as the styled map and satellite image option buttons are all in their correct positions and work.
4. Click on a cluster on the map to ensure that the maps sooms to the location of a cluster to reveal the cluster in that area.
5. Click on all markers to ensure that they launch and the the text, images and links are correct.
6. Search for a place using search bar and ensure that the markers generated by this search are new markers without text from infowindows added to the maps by the developers.
6. Repeat footer checks as described in step four of the Home section 
7. Review of all functionality and responsiveness on mobile screen size by using <a href="https://www.responsinator.com/">Responsinator</a>

It was noted during the testing that for some of the infowindows on a small screen size that the infowindow could be obscured by the Place Autocomplete card at the top of the map viewport. The size of the images in the infowindows was reduced to lessen this effect however, a slight issue still remains. However, a user would be able to reposition the infowindow on the map to read it and to close it down.

During testing it was noted that when a search term was selected in the autocomplete search box the resulting marker would have the same inforwindow information as the last entry in the infowindow content matrix (named content). To fix this issue different variables had to be defined for the markers used in the autocomplete search and the infowindow markers already present on the map.

#### Submissions

1. Repeat Navbar checks as described in step one of the Home section
2. Submissions Form
    1. Submit empty form without any data and check that an error message appears in the first empty field
    2. Submit the form with an empty Name field and check that a relevant error message appears
